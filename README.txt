Hello, Sir Madera! This is our little message for you -SintaDrive

1) After downloading car_rental_system folder, move the folder to XAMPP/htdocs/
2) Then, open XAMPP, go to Manage Servers then start MySQL Database and Apache Web Server
3) If there's a button "Go to Application", click it. If there's none go to url: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
4) In http://localhost/phpmyadmin/, go tp import tab then select car_rental.sql sql file
-------You should see the car_rental database with its 7 tables (Bookings, Cars, Car_Location, Car_status, Client, Locations, Payments)---------

url for client-side: http://localhost/car_rental_system/index.php

To access admin-side, inside the url for client-side, you will see the Profile icon, hover it you will see the dropdown
with choice (Login and Register). Select login, then you will be directed to url: http://localhost/car_rental_system/choose_login.php.

In there, select ADMIN then type this credentials for admin:
username: admin_user
password: admin_password

Thank you so much, Sir Joshua! -SintaDrive
